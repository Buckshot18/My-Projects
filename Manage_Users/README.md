How It Works
The system operates by reading and writing data to several plain text files:

user.txt: This file stores user login credentials, including usernames and passwords. It's essential for user authentication and managing who can access the system.
tasks.txt: This is the core of the task management system, holding all task details. Each entry includes who the task is assigned to, its title, description, due date, the date it was created, and whether it's completed or not.
task_overview.txt: Generated by administrators, this report provides a summary of all tasks. It gives a bird's-eye view of task statistics, such as the total number of tasks and percentages of completed, incomplete, and overdue tasks.
user_overview.txt: Also an admin-generated report, this file offers a breakdown of tasks per user. It details how many tasks each user has, their completion rates, and how many are overdue, helping administrators monitor individual workloads.
Core Functionality
The program's main features include:

User Login: Securely authenticates users against stored credentials.
User Registration (r): Allows administrators to add new users to the system.
Task Management (a, va, vm): Users can add new tasks, view all tasks, or view only the tasks assigned to them.
Task Editing: Users can mark tasks as complete or modify details like the assigned user or due date for incomplete tasks.
Reporting (gr, ds): Administrators can generate comprehensive reports on task and user statistics, providing valuable insights into project progress and team performance.
Essentially, this system provides a straightforward way to manage tasks and users by storing and updating data in easily readable text files, making it a practical tool for basic task tracking.
